  **foobar** is special. It is not *your* average tool.

  Even more description. YAML is great for that kind of stuff, you
  could put anything here, includeing markup of any kind, even
  nest another yaml document, as long as you keep the indent-levels
  consistent.

    if you indent stuff
    you get a **block quote**.

                  Neat!

  Continuing with my block from before. It is super important to 
  completely ignore what I am writing here.

options:
  - short: c
    long: config-file
    argument: path
    description: |
      Read configuration from <path>. If ommited, the configuration is 
      read from `$FOOBAR_HOME/config.json`

      I don't know what else to say. Maybe  a blockquote:

          There is text
          And there is stupid text
      
  - short: h
    long: help
